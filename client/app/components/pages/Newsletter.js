            <h4>Pacific Fish Have Gotten Smaller</h4>
            <p>by Liz Osborn CurrentResults.com</p>

            <p class="quote">The size of fish living near the ocean floor along the Pacific coast of the United States has declined dramatically in two decades.
Between 1980 and 2001, the average weight of rockfish, flatfish and skates dropped by nearly half.
Flatfish, including sole, netted off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington in 2001 typically weighed in only 57% as heavy as the average flatfish caught in 1980. Cartilaginous fish such as skate caught in 2001 averaged two-thirds (67%) the weight of those landed in 1980.
These size decreases don't entirely account for the overall 45% reduction in the average weight of bottom-dwelling fish. The shrinking is also due to larger species of fish becoming much less prevalent.</p>

            <p>Populations of the bigger rockfish species dropped by 5 to 17% a year between 1977 and 2001. For two species, the declines are particularly alarming. After 1977, numbers of canary rockfish along the US west coast plummeted by 85% and boccacio rockfish by 96%.At the same time, populations have actually increased for most of the 31 groundfish species studied by scientists from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. Cartilaginous fish doubled in number between 1977 and 2001. Flatfish became eight times more plentiful during the same period. Small species of rockfish, such as greenstripped and splitnose, experienced similar population growth, generally increasing over 6% annually.
The species in decline can be distinguished by their life histories. They are generally long-lived fish, that grow large and reproduce slowly. </p>

            <p>The radically different population trends among species have overturned the Pacific Ocean's bottom-dwelling fish communities. Rockfish have gone from making up 60% of the fish caught in 1977 surveys to only 17% in 2001. Flatfish that used to make up 34% of catches, more recently comprise 80% of the fish netted. Flatfish have overtaken rockfish to become the dominant type of fish living near the US Pacific coast seabed.
s restructured the mix of these west coast fish. But declines in the later-maturing rockfish are greater than can be attributed to fishing alone. The flip in fish communities may have created conditions where canary and boccacio rockfish can no longer thrive.
What's most disturbing about these results, the authors of this study point out, is the revelation that even after fishing is curtailed, long-lived species may never recover from heavy harvesting.</p>

            <h4>Exotic Species Endanger Native Fish</h4>
            <p>by Liz Osborn CurrentResults.com</p>
            <p class="quote">
Non-native fish are already implicated in the extinctions of five fish species in Canada and they threaten the continued existence of many others.
Invasive species jeopardize 26 of the freshwater fish species, sub-species and isolated populations considered by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2003 as endangered or threatened.
Usually several factors in unison contribute to the declining numbers of fish at risk. Loss and degradation of wetlands, lakes and rivers are certainly the most widespread problems. Invasive species pose the second most prevalent peril.</p>

            <p>Nation-wide, natural fish populations are being harmed by fifteen species of invasive fish, particularly pumpkinseed, sea lamprey, alewife and black spotted goby. Most of these fish were introduced into Canadian waters without sanction in attempts to improve sport fishing. Besides exotic fish, the aquatic plants Eurasian watermilfoil and reed-canary grass are also devastating for some local species.
Introduced animals and plants have made the greatest dent in native fish biodiversity within watersheds of the Great Lakes and upper St. Lawrence River, and on Pacific islands off the coast of British Columbia.
One widespread menace, rainbow smelt, got its start in 1912 when it was released into Crystal Lake to help feed trout. Smelts rapidly moved into all the Great Lakes and hundreds of smaller lakes in central Canada, aided by anglers using the fish as bait. They have already propelled blue pike to extinction and now threaten four other native species.</p>

            <p>Brown bullhead, a type of catfish, is one of the worst offenders, affecting nine native species. Within years, bullheads gobbling up enough eggs to wipe out two stickleback species unique to Hadley Lake on Lasqueti Island in BC. The ongoing spread of brown bullheads seems to make extinction inevitable for four more stickleback species on nearby Texada Island, and two in Enos Lake on Vancouver Island.
In addition to the sticklebacks, native fish which are particularly struggling against the consequences of introductions are pugnose shiner, Cultus pygmy sculpin, Lake Utopia dwarf smelt, and deepwater sculpin in the Great Lakes. Invasive species have also furthered declines of the endangered Salish sucker, northern madtom, Atlantic whitefish, Cultus sockeye salmon, and Atlantic salmon of the inner Bay of Fundy. Some of these fish are unsuccessfully coping with more than one exotic species.
